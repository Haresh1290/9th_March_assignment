    "The Probability Mass function is defined on all the values of R, where it takes all the arguments of any real number. It doesn’t belong to the value of X when the argument value equals to zero and when the argument belongs to x, the value of PMF should be positive.\n",

    "The probability mass function is usually the primary component of defining a discrete probability distribution, but it differs from the probability density function (PDF) where it produces distinct outcomes. This is the reason why probability mass function is used in computer programming and statistical modelling.

The word “mass“ indicates the probabilities that are concentrated on discrete events.\n",

    "One reason the normal distribution is important is that many psychological and educational variables are distributed approximately normally. Measures of reading ability, introversion, job satisfaction, and memory are among the many psychological variables approximately normally distributed. Although the distributions are only approximately normal, they are usually quite close. A second reason the normal distribution is so important is that it is easy for mathematical statisticians to work with. This means that many kinds of statistical tests can be derived for normal distributions. Almost all statistical tests discussed in this text assume normal distributions. Fortunately, these tests work very well even if the distribution is only approximately normally distributed. Some tests work well even with very wide deviations from normality. Finally, if the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution are known, it is easy to convert back and forth from raw scores to percentiles.\n",

    "\n",
    "So: A discrete probability distribution describes the probability that each possible value of a discrete random variable will occur—for example, the probability of getting a six when rolling a die. When dealing with discrete variables, the probability of each value falls between 0 and 1, and the sum of all the probabilities is equal to 1. So, in the die example, assuming we’re using a standard die, the probability of rolling a six is 0.167, or 16.7%. This is based on dividing 1 (the sum of all probabilities) by 6 (the number of possible outcomes).\n",

    "Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",

    "What Is Uniform Distribution?\n",
    "In statistics, uniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line, so for a coin flip returning a head or tail, both have a probability p = 0.50 and would be depicted by a line from the y-axis at 0.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Uniform Distribution\n",
    "There are two types of uniform distributions: discrete and continuous. The possible results of rolling a die provide an example of a discrete uniform distribution: it is possible to roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it is not possible to roll a 2.3, 4.7, or 5.5. Therefore, the roll of a die generates a discrete distribution with p = 1/6 for each outcome. There are only 6 possible values to return and nothing in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution vs. Normal Distribution\n",
    "Probability distributions help you decide the probability of a future event. Some of the most common probability distributions are discrete uniform, binomial, continuous uniform, normal, and exponential. Perhaps one of the most familiar and widely used is the normal distribution, often depicted as a bell curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distributions show how continuous data is distributed and assert that most of the data is concentrated on the mean or average. In a normal distribution, the area under the curve equals 1 and 68.27% of all data falls within 1 standard deviation—how dispersed the numbers are—from the mean; 95.45% of all data falls within 2 standard deviations from the mean, and approximately 99.73% of all data falls within 3 standard deviations from the mean.\n",
    "1\n",
    "﻿ As the data moves away from the mean, the frequency of data occurring decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete uniform distribution shows that variables in a range have the same probability of occurring. There are no variations in probable outcomes and the data is discrete, rather than continuous. Its shape resembles a rectangle, rather than the normal distribution's bell. Like a normal distribution, however, the area under the graph is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Uniform Distribution\n",
    "There are 52 cards in a traditional deck of cards. In it are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains an A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, and 2 jokers. However, we'll do away with the jokers and face cards for this example, focusing only on number cards replicated in each suit. As a result, we are left with 40 cards, a set of discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to know the probability of pulling a 2 of hearts from the modified deck. The probability of pulling a 2 of hearts is 1/40 or 2.5%. Each card is unique; therefore, the likelihood that you will pull any one of the cards in the deck is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the likelihood of pulling a heart from the deck. The probability is significantly higher. Why? We are now only concerned with the suits in the deck. Since there are only four suits, pulling a heart yields a probability of 1/4 or 25%."

    "What Is Z-Score?\n",
    "Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In investing and trading, Z-scores are measures of an instrument's variability and can be used by traders to help determine volatility. The Z-score is sometimes confused with the Altman Z-score, which is calculated using factors taken from a company's financial reports. The Altman Z-score is used to calculate the likelihood that a business will go bankrupt in the next two years, while the Z-score can be used to determine how far a stock's return differs from it's average return—and much more.\n",

    "A Z-Score is a statistical measurement of a score's relationship to the mean in a group of scores.\n",
    "A Z-score can reveal to a trader if a value is typical for a specified data set or if it is atypical.\n",
    "In general, a Z-score of -3.0 to 3.0 suggests that a stock is trading within three standard deviations of its mean.\n",
    "Traders have developed many methods that use z-score to identify correlations between trades, trading positions, and evaluate trading strategies.\n",
    "Z-Score Formula\n",

    "z = ( 57 - 52 ) / 4\n",
    "z = 1.25\n",

    "The central limit theorem relies on the concept of a sampling distribution, which is the probability distribution of a statistic for a large number of samples taken from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagining an experiment may help you to understand sampling distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you draw a random sample from a population and calculate a statistic for the sample, such as the mean.\n",
    "Now you draw another random sample of the same size, and again calculate the mean.\n",
    "You repeat this process many times, and end up with a large number of means, one for each sample.\n",
    "The distribution of the sample means is an example of a sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem says that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough. Regardless of whether the population has a normal, Poisson, binomial, or any other distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution, with increasingly fewer observations the further from the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central limit theorem formula\n",
    "Fortunately, you don’t need to actually repeatedly sample a population to know the shape of the sampling distribution. The parameters of the sampling distribution of the mean are determined by the parameters of the population:\n",

    "\n",
    "Central limit theorem and the normality assumption\n",
    "Due to central limit theory, the assumption of normality implied in many statistical tests and estimators is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is the basis of much statistical theory. Hypothesis tests and interval estimators based on the normal distribution are often more powerful than their non-parametric equivalents. When the distribution assumption can be met they are preferred as the increased power means a smaller sample size can be used to detect the same difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, violation of the assumption is often not a problem, due to the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that the sample means of moderately large samples are often well-approximated by a normal distribution even if the data are not normally distributed. For many samples, the test statistic often approaches a normal distribution for non-skewed data when the sample size is as small as 30, and for moderately skewed data when the sample size is larger than 100. The downside in such situations is a reduction in statistical power, and there may be more powerful non-parametric tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a transformation such as a logarithm can remove the skewness and allow you to use powerful tests based on the normality assumption."
